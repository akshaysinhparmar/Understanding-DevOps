DevOps means linking legacy apps with newer cloud-native apps and infrastructure.
 ### What is DevOps ?
 The **_"DevOps"_** is a combination of two words **"development"** and **"operations"** but it represents a set of ideas and practices much larger than those two terms alone, or together. DevOps includes security, collaborative ways of working, data analytics, and many other things.
 
### What do containers have to do with DevOps? 
DevOps speeds up how an idea goes from development to deployment. At its core, DevOps relies on automating routine operational tasks and standardizing environments across an app’s lifecycle. **Containers** can offer **standardized environments** , but you need a platform to manage them that also offers built-in automations and support for any infrastructure.

### DevOps process
 just changing your development and operations processes isn’t enough. You’ll need to apply systems thinking to really optimize the way you deliver software. This means DevOps will lead to changes in the business units that request dev work and in the groups that support the end users. A continuous cycle of feedback from end users to the business is the key.
 DevOps teams will often build their software using a microservices architecture and link these services together with APIs. Teams deliver faster by focusing on creating smaller pieces of functionality so you’ll have to focus on how those services and APIs are managed and have a strategy, like agile integration, for bringing it all together

### DevOps platform & tools
Selecting tools that support your processes is critical for DevOps to be successful. If your operations are going to keep pace with rapid development cycles they’ll need to use highly flexible platforms and treat their infrastructure like dev teams treat code.
Platform provisioning and deployment can be simplified through automation. **Site reliability engineering (SRE)** takes these manually operations tasks and manages them using software and automation. An SRE approach can further support the goals of a DevOps team.
Containers make it easier to move applications between development, testing, and production environments. Using containers lets developers package and isolate their apps with everything they need to run, including application files, runtime environments, dependent libraries and configurations https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers

### DevOps and Kubernetes
Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized application
#### Build applications and manage containers using Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration platform that helps manage _distributed, containerized applications at massive scale_. You tell **Kubernetes** where you want your software to run, and the platform takes care of almost everything else.
detail shows how Kubernetes helps organizations build applications and manage containers on site and across hybrid cloud environments. It provides:
